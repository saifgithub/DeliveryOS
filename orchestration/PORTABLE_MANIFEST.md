# Portable manifest — what to copy into a new repo

Three tiers. **A** copies byte-for-byte. **B** is written once per project. **C** never leaves the
repo it was created in.

The split has two invariants, and every file in tier A is checked against both.

**1 — No project detail.** A portable file names no project, no host, no person, no path outside
this tree, and no work-item id. If you find one in a tier-A file, that is a bug in the split — move
it to BINDINGS rather than preserving it.

**2 — No incident history.** State the rule and the mechanism it defends against; do **not** narrate
the incident that produced it. Another repo did not live through our outages, cannot verify our
numbers, and pays tokens to read them in every agent context that loads these files. *"10 of 14
lanes shipped ungated"* is our evidence; *"a board that reads the Architect's own token without a
verdict cannot express «shipped without a gate»"* is the portable rule. Keep the second, drop the
first — the reasoning survives, the archaeology goes to BINDINGS or the commit log.

## Tier A — copy verbatim (16 files)

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `PORTABLE_MANIFEST.md` | this file |
| `README.md` | map of the two layers; start here |
| `ROLES.md` | the four-role model + the load-bearing rules |
| `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` | the portable DoD questions (answers live in tier B) |
| `history/README.md` | what the durable-memory tree is for |
| `dispatch/DISPATCH_PROTOCOL.md` | Architect ↔ instance contract, tokens, state table, the gate |
| `dispatch/dispatch.sh` | state deriver + watcher (`state` / `inbox` / `architect` / `inst <id>`) |
| `dispatch/rotate_trail.py` | ledger retention, ledger-agnostic |
| `dispatch/loop_prompts/ARCHITECT.md` | Architect role prompt |
| `dispatch/loop_prompts/AUDITOR.md` | Auditor role prompt (dispatch-layer wrapper) |
| `dispatch/loop_prompts/CODER.md` | Coder role prompt |
| `dispatch/loop_prompts/NONCODER.md` | Non-coder role prompt (requester + maintainer) |
| `audit/PROTOCOL.md` | builder ↔ Auditor contract — **wins on any verification conflict** |
| `audit/ARCHITECT_LOOP_PROMPT.md` | the architect's audit-layer loop |
| `audit/AUDITOR_LOOP_PROMPT.md` | the auditor's loop |
| `audit/watcher.sh` | audit-lane state deriver + watcher |

No code changes are needed in any of them. `dispatch.sh`, `watcher.sh` and `rotate_trail.py` take
their locations from their own script directory or from flags.

## Tier B — write once for the new project

| File | What to put in it |
|---|---|
| `dispatch/BINDINGS.md` | every `<TOKEN>` the portable files use, plus caps, hosting/launch commands, the hot-file registry, and the escalation precedents this project has actually paid for |
| `audit/<PROJECT>_BINDINGS.md` | the audit layer's term resolution + gap-fills. Name it after the project so a re-copy of `PROTOCOL.md` can never clobber it |
| `dispatch/roster/<instance-id>.md` | one per instance. Adding a file adds an instance — nothing hardcodes the roster |
| the project's own DoD bindings | the answers to `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`'s questions, plus any rows this project adds. Lives with the project's governance docs, not in this tree |
| `dispatch/board.md`, `dispatch/trail.md` | seed the headers only |

**Tokens BINDINGS must resolve before the first lane is dispatched.** An unbound token is a stand-up
error, not an empty cell:

`<ORCH_ROOT>` · `<DISPATCH_ROOT>` · `<AUDIT_ROOT>` · `<AUDIT_LANE_DIR>` · `<WORKTREE_DIR>` ·
`<TAG_PREFIX>` · the stakeholder · shared branch · change registers · the test command per surface ·
the contract check · the long-running test command · the content self-test · live-stack verification
· the device-only marker · caps and the stall window.

## Tier B′ — copy and adapt (project-coupled scripts)

These are useful shapes, not portable code. Each hardcodes a repo path, a package manager, or a test
target. Copy them as starting points and rewrite the project-specific lines; do **not** treat an
unedited copy as working.

| Script | What is coupled |
|---|---|
| `dispatch/dispatch_launch.sh` | absolute repo path, cost-tier table, worktree convention |
| `dispatch/dispatch_audit.sh` | test runner, suite runtime, corpus-test path, forbidden-file list |
| `dispatch/dispatch_verify.sh` | the ground-truth checks for this repo's layout |
| `dispatch/run_full_suite.sh` | the full-suite command and its output contract |
| `dispatch/intake/*.TEMPLATE.md` | the intake draft shape — but its category list, bug-source reference and exclusion rules are this project's |

## Tier C — never copy (runtime state)

`dispatch/lanes/` · `dispatch/intake/` (except the `*.TEMPLATE.md` above) · `dispatch/DELIVERY_PLAN.md` ·
`audit/cr/` · `audit/runs/` · `audit/regression/` · `audit/audit-trail.md` · `history/lanes/` ·
`history/trail/`

These are one repo's operational history. Copying them imports another project's lanes, verdicts and
regression pins as if they were yours — creating exactly the fabricated evidence the audit layer
exists to prevent. Create the directories empty. `DELIVERY_PLAN.md` is the Architect's *current* wave
plan — dated, greenlit by one stakeholder, scoped to specific work-item ids; a new project writes its
own when it has a wave to plan, and inheriting someone else's reads as a mandate nobody gave.

## Standing it up

1. Copy tier A. Copy tier B′ if you want the launch helpers.
2. Write the two BINDINGS files, resolving every token above.
3. Write one `roster/<instance-id>.md` per intended instance.
4. Point the project's governance checklist at `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` and answer its rows.
5. Seed `board.md` / `trail.md` headers; create the tier-C directories empty.
6. `sh dispatch/dispatch.sh state` — it should print an empty board without error. That is the
   replication smoke test.

## Keeping the split honest

The split rots in one direction only: a rule gets clearer when you cite the incident that produced
it, so project detail drifts *into* the portable files. Re-run the check when you touch this tree:

```sh
# from the orchestration root — every hit is a candidate defect in the split
grep -rniE "<this project's name>|<hosts>|<the stakeholder's name>" \
  README.md ROLES.md DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md history/README.md \
  audit/PROTOCOL.md audit/*_LOOP_PROMPT.md audit/watcher.sh \
  dispatch/DISPATCH_PROTOCOL.md dispatch/dispatch.sh dispatch/rotate_trail.py \
  dispatch/loop_prompts/
```

Write the incident down where it belongs: the rule in the portable file, the evidence in BINDINGS.
