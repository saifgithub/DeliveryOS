# watcher.sh - lane-state watcher for the audit handshake (PROTOCOL.md v2 lanes).
# Derives per-item state from the two lane files exactly as PROTOCOL.md defines it:
#   AWAITING_AUDIT : architect SUBMITTED round > auditor VERDICT round, or no auditor file yet
#   AWAITING_FIXES : auditor's LATEST verdict keyword is AWAITING_FIXES (keyword wins, per protocol note)
#   COMPLETE       : auditor's latest verdict keyword is COMPLETE and rounds have caught up
# Usage:
#   watcher.sh state                     print the derived state table once and exit
#   watcher.sh auditor   [-i N] [-t N]   block until >=1 lane is AWAITING_AUDIT  (poll every N s, default 30)
#   watcher.sh architect [-i N] [-t N]   block until >=1 lane is AWAITING_FIXES
# -t bounds the wait: give up after N seconds and exit 3 instead of blocking forever. Omit it only
# in an interactive session someone can interrupt; a one-shot agent has no such interrupt.
# Exit codes: 0 work found (or table printed) · 2 bad usage · 3 timed out with no work.
# Env: HANDSHAKE_CR_DIR overrides the lane directory (default: <script dir>/cr).
# Portable POSIX sh, no dependencies.
