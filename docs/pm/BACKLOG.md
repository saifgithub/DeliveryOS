## § B-001 — Cast DeliveryOS into the DeliveryOS structure

**What:** Run DeliveryOS development through the DeliveryOS SDLC workflow — use the extension to manage its own v0.2 (or next-feature) work from raw idea through verified release.

**Why:** The dogfooding claim in `docs/essay/meta-harness.md` is currently partial — the BUILD-PLAN + chunk specs were produced by the O/R/P multi-track session model, not by the extension UI itself. Closing the loop means the next feature cycle runs through the full in-extension workflow: raw idea → discovery → PRD → requirements catalogue → test spec → execution brief → harness run → result capture → diff → verification → release evidence.

**Pre-conditions:**
- v0.1.0 tagged and published (screenshots + video done, `git push`, GitHub release live).
- Extension installed from the published `.vsix` (not from source) into VS Code.

**Steps (one-time setup):**
1. Open this repo (`/Volumes/Extreme Pro/DeliveryOS`) in VS Code with the published extension active.
2. Run **DeliveryOS: Create Project** → name it "DeliveryOS".
3. Confirm `.deliveryos/memory.sqlite` initialises at the repo root.
4. Open the **Raw idea** panel — paste the v0.2 (or next-feature) raw intent.
5. Run the discovery interview; paste answers.
6. Generate PRD draft; iterate in the PRD editor.
7. Decompose PRD into requirements catalogue.
8. Run Test Designer for each requirement.
9. Compose an Execution Brief for the first requirement.
10. Select a harness profile (Claude Code); click **Run with Claude Code**.
11. Let Claude Code implement; capture result via the Result Capture panel.
12. Run the Allowed/Forbidden diff; check the diff-results panel.
13. Run Verification; complete the Memory Update gate; export Release Evidence.
14. Note: what broke, what was confusing, what was missing — these become b-track bugs or v0.3 requirements.

**Success signal:** at least one requirement implemented and verified with release evidence exported — all via the extension UI, not the command line.

**Session tag when picked up:** DOS:P5 (or a dedicated R-track session if implementation work is needed).
